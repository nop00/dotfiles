dotfiles
========

Just my dotfiles, nothing really crazy.  
For now it's just my .vimrcs. Since I share my time between a Windows box at work and a Linux laptop at home, there are multiple files:
* .vimrc: Linux-specific configuration
* _vimrc: Windows + work-specific configuration
* .vimrc.common: all the common stuff (duh)

The files are commented, mostly in english, but also in french. Sue me.
