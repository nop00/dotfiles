dotfiles
========

Just my dotfiles, nothing really crazy.
For now it's just my .vimrcs. Since I share my time between a Windows box at work and a Linux laptop at home, there are multiple files:
* .vimrc: the Linux file, which sources .vimrc.lin then .vimrc.all
* .vimrc.lin: this file contains all the Linux-specific stuff
* _vimrc: the Windows file, which sources .vimrc.win then .vimrc.all
* .vimrc.win: the file containing all the Windows and work-specific stuff

You know what ? Writing this, I realized I could do with less files.
Back in a tick :)
